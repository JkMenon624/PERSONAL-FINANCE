The Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based application designed to simplify expense management by providing users with a structured platform to log, analyze,
and visualize their financial transactions. Developed using Python, Streamlit, SQLite, Pandas, and
Plotly, this application offers an intuitive interface for recording daily expenses, filtering transactions,
and generating insightful financial reports.
The tracker features a centralized dashboard that displays total spending, category-wise breakdowns,
and interactive visualizations such as pie charts and line graphs to help users monitor their financial
trends. Users can filter their expenses based on date and category, allowing for customized analysis of
their spending habits. The application stores transaction data securely in an SQLite database, ensuring
data persistence and easy retrieval.
This project aims to promote financial awareness by providing users with real-time spending insights,
enabling better budgeting and expense control. While the current version focuses on expense tracking,
future enhancements could include income management, automated budget planning, AI-driven
financial insights, and cloud integration. The Personal Finance Tracker is a step towards fostering
financial discipline and data-driven decision-making in personal finance management.
